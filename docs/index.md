# infra Provider



The Infra provider is used to interact with resources supported by [Infra](https://infrahq.com). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure Infra Terraform provider.
provider "infra" {
  access_key = "xxxxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
}
```

## Authentication

The Infra provider must be configured with an access key in order to authenticate with the API server. The access key, and other arguments, can be configured in two ways: through Terraform as provider configurations or through environment variables.

### Environment Variables

The access key can be sourced from the `INFRA_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable.

```terraform
provider "infra" {}
```

```shell
$ export INFRA_ACCESS_KEY='xxxxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'
$ terraform plan
```

- `access_key` (String, Sensitive) The access key used to authenticate with the Infra server. Can also be sourced from `INFRA_ACCESS_KEY`.

### Optional

- `host` (String) The Infra server instance Terraform will communicate with. Can also be sourced from `INFRA_HOST`. Default is `https://api.infrahq.com`.
- `server_certificate` (String) The server's PEM-encoded public certificate for client verification. Can also be sourced from `INFRA_SERVER_CERTIFICATE`. Cannot be used with `skip_tls_verify`, `server_certificate_file`.
- `server_certificate_file` (String) The server's PEM-encoded public certificate file for client verification. Can also be sourced from `INFRA_SERVER_CERTIFICATE_FILE`. Cannot be used with `skip_tls_verify`, `server_certificate`.
- `skip_tls_verify` (Boolean) Controls client verification of the server certificate. This should only be `true` for testing or development. Can also be sourced from`INFRA_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY`. Cannot be used with `server_certificate`, `server_certificate_file`.
